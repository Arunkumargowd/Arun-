[200~The Certificate of Cloud Security


 Knowledge (CCSK) is 
a certification offered by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), 
and it covers cloud security principles and best practices.
 As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the CSA doesn't specifically provide a certification called "CSA in AWS," but they do offer the CCSK certification, which is vendor-neutral and covers various cloud service providers, including AWS.

The CCSK exam is designed to validate an individual's knowledge of key cloud security issues, architecture, governance, compliance, and operations. If you are specifically looking for AWS-related certification, you might want to consider the AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty certification.

Here's an overview of the CCSK syllabus:
